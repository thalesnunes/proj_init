#Project Initializer

Everytime you want to start a project you do the basics. go to your projects folder, create a new folder for the project, do your git commands, sync the repo, add a README file and push your initial commit.

That is what this simple project is for, making your life easier, and doing all that automatically for you.

P.S.: This is only for Windows

Setting up:

1. Create two Environment Variables:

    - First named `git` with the value being a Github Personal Access Token
    - Second named `mp` with the value being the path to where you want your automatic projects to be created

2. Add this repo's directory path to your systems PATH variable

3. Finally, type `create {repo_name}` on your CMD or PowerShell terminal

Optional: You can also use the flags `-p or --private` to start the repo as private or `-l or --local` to create it locally

Happy Coding!
