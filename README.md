# Project Initializer

Everytime you want to start a project you do the basics. go to your projects folder, create a new folder for the project, do your git commands, sync the repo, add a README file and push your initial commit.

That is what this simple project is for, making your life easier, and doing all that automatically for you.

Setting up:

1. Create two Environment Variables:

    - First named `GIT_AUTOMATION` with the value being a Github Personal Access Token
    - Second named `PROJECTS` with the value being the path to where you want your automatic projects to be created

2. Install the requirements.

3. Usability: `python3 create [-h] [-l] [-p] <repo_name>`.

Happy Coding!
